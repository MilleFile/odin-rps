A simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors to be played in the console.

Notes after completion:

Trying to make the code extendable (in this case, a variable number of rounds inputted by the user) led to some inconsistencies in creation. In the future, stick to design decisions by making them more obvious, either with comments or notes.
